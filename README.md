# Light_Image_Segmentation_By_Mask_RCNN
User Instruction:
1. Import the ipynb file and the mrcnn folder into google colab. The ipynb contains the main architecture of of the segmentation code. The mrcnn folder contains the main code of modified Mask-RCNN. 
2. The train dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle 2018, https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018, the stage1_train.zip.
3. Two training modes are available, "all layers" or "head only". It can be switched by changing the variable "layers" in the training part. The model need to be trained before using. 
4. The variable TEST_PATH need to be changed to the corresponding path that the test image locate at.
5. The code are well commented. Check the ipynb for detailed instruction.
